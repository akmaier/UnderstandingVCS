## Conformance scoreboard (jaxtari↔xitari, `*_noop_10` fixtures, last frame)

Ground truth is **xitari** (`tools/trace_dump`). `jaxtari ≡ jutari` is the
PXC2 invariant (the two ports must diverge from xitari *identically*).
Numbers = RAM bytes differing from xitari on the last frame.

| ROM | divergence | notes |
|---|---|---|
| pong | **0** | bit-exact (was 6 before P3i-g) |
| breakout | **0** | bit-exact (was 2 before P3i-g) |
| space_invaders | 0 | bit-exact |
| seaquest | 4 | improved from 6 by P3i-g |
| pitfall | 19 | joystick; unchanged |
| enduro | 43 | = pre-P3i-g parent baseline (part 1 briefly hit 46; part 2 beam_cc+always-defer fixed it → NO net regression) |

**Screen scoreboard** (PXC-S, per-frame max screen ndiff vs xitari, `*_noop_10` fixtures, after P3i-g pt3):

| ROM | screen ndiff | notes |
|---|---|---|
| breakout | **8** | only 1 row residual (P1 corner block on row 195, likely VDELP1 shadow) |
| pong | **920** | dropped 29760→920 by COLU `& 0xFE` mask (pt4); residual is real sprite/timing |
| space_invaders | 2145 | rendering gap |
| pitfall | 1786 | rendering gap |
| seaquest | 3940 | rendering gap (improved 3946→3940 by pt3 NUSIZ +1) |
| enduro | 1972 | rendering gap (improved 1988→1972 by pt3 NUSIZ +1) |

The pinned counts live in `jaxtari/tests/test_pxc2_jaxtari_vs_jutari.py`
(`_PXC2_CASES`). **If you change emulation behaviour and a pin moves, update
the pin AND regenerate the jutari fixtures in the same commit** so both ports
move in lock-step (recipe in that file's header comment).

## Patches landed (newest first)

### P3i-g part 4 — mask `COLU* & 0xFE` (pong screen 29760 → 920) (2026-05-30)
**Symptom:** PXC-S pong screen ndiff was 29760/frame — almost the entire
160×210 framebuffer differing from xitari, despite RAM being bit-exact and
the rendered frames *looking* identical to the eye in the side-by-side
video.
**Diagnosis:** Compared the per-pixel byte values: xitari produced even
palette indices (228, 138, 250); jaxtari/jutari the odd siblings
(229, 139, 251). The Stella NTSC palette has the same RGB at index N and
N+1, so the rendered colour is identical — only the encoded byte differs.
Checked xitari `TIA::poke` cases 0x06–0x09 (COLUP0/COLUP1/COLUPF/COLUBK):
they each mask `value & 0xFE` ("bit 0 of the color-luminance registers is
unused on real NMOS hardware"). My code stored the raw value, so any ROM
that wrote an odd luminance produced odd palette indices.
**Fix:** in both ports' `tia_poke`/`tia_poke!`, mask `value & 0xFE` when
`reg` is COLUP0/COLUP1/COLUPF/COLUBK (`0x06..0x09`).
**Result:** **pong screen 29760 → 920** (97% reduction; the remaining
920 px is real sprite/timing divergence — paddles/ball/score positions).
Other ROMs unchanged (they happened to only write even luminance values
already). RAM unchanged everywhere (this is a TIA-register store, not
game logic).

### P3i-g part 3 — NUSIZ wide-mode +1 pixel offset (Breakout paddle 1 px off) (2026-05-30)
**Symptom:** After P3i-g pt2 fixed Breakout's walls + bricks + red columns,
the paddle was still 1 px off from xitari (jaxtari at x=98-113, xitari at
99-114; same paddle width, just shifted left by one). The numerics agreed
end-to-end — RESP0 → POSP0=96, HMOVE delta +2 → POSP0=98 — so the difference
had to be on the render side, not the position side. (A 1-cycle RESP0 shift
would be 3 px, so the residual couldn't be cycle-accuracy.)
**Diagnosis:** Probed jaxtari's full RESP0/HMP0/HMOVE/HMCLR chain for the
boot+1 frame, confirmed it matches xitari's `UV_TIA_POKES` log exactly.
Then inspected xitari's `computePlayerMaskTable`: the mask init for player
mode 7 (quad-size, NUSIZ=7, 4× scale) and mode 5 (double-size, NUSIZ=5,
2× scale) both have the comment "for some reason in double/quad size mode
the player's output is delayed by one pixel thus we use > instead of >=" —
a documented NMOS-TIA quirk that shifts wide-mode players one pixel right.
**Fix (both ports):** in `_overlay_player` / `_player_set`, add a +1 pixel
offset to the rendered/collision base position when `scale > 1` (modes 5
and 7). Mirrors xitari's mask offset exactly.
**Result:** Breakout paddle now at x=99-114, byte-identical to xitari on
rows 189-194; screen-vs-xitari ndiff dropped **16 → 8 per frame** (the
only residual is an 8-px corner block xitari draws on row 195 that we
miss — looks like a P1 VDELP-shadow scanline). The same fix improved
**seaquest 3946→3940** and **enduro 1988→1972** (those games also use
the wide player modes). pong/space_invaders/pitfall unchanged. RAM stays
bit-exact for breakout (collision-set patch is correctness-faithful, not
behaviour-changing).

### P3i-g part 2 — beam_cc threading + always-defer PF writes (Breakout "red columns" / flicker) (2026-05-29)
**Symptom (user report):** Breakout's *first* frame already showed big red
vertical columns in the lower (below-bricks) screen, and heavy frame-to-frame
flicker. RAM was bit-exact (PXC green) — a pure **rendering** bug, invisible
to the RAM-only tests.
**Diagnosis tools:** `UV_TIA_POKES=1 ./tools/trace_dump …` (xitari's per-poke
xpos/delay/activation log) + a monkeypatch logger of jaxtari's `tia_poke`
PF2 writes. Found: xitari clears the playfield for the lower screen with
`PF2=$00` at **scanline 127, xpos=0** (HBLANK), after which no more PF writes
— so the lower screen stays black. My code issued the same `PF2=$00` but at
**scanline 126, beam_cc=225** (1 CPU cycle / 3 color clocks earlier, a cumulative
sub-cycle drift), where `activation = 225+3 = 228 ≥ 228` → it fell through to
**immediate-apply**. Then the scanline-126 render **drained the still-pending
`PF2=$ff@68` and `PF2=$3f@156`**, which clobbered the register back to `$3f`
(bits 0-5 = pixels 12-17 = x48-71). That `$3f` then persisted into the lower
screen — the red columns. Frame-to-frame the brick scroll changed which value
won the clobber race → flicker.
**Two-part fix (both ports):**
  1. **beam_cc threading** (replaces the P3i-g-part-1 inline `tia_advance`
     flush): `Bus._bus_poke` passes the *effective* sub-instruction beam
     position (`beam_cc = color_clock + pending*3`, `beam_sc = scanline_cycle
     + pending`) to `tia_poke`, which uses it for the PF defer + RES*/HMOVE.
     The TIA is **not** advanced/rendered mid-instruction — it advances exactly
     ONCE per instruction in `_tia_post_step`. (The part-1 inline flush rendered
     scanlines mid-instruction, which is what let a pre-clear PF pattern leak.)
  2. **Always-defer PF writes**: removed the "fall through to immediate-apply
     when `activation ≥ 228`" path in `tia_poke`/`tia_poke!`. A PF write whose
     effect crosses into the next scanline now stays in `pending_writes`;
     `tia_advance`'s drain-remaining step applies it LAST (after the in-loop
     drains), into `final_registers` — so it is NOT clobbered by an earlier
     same-register pending write, and it correctly carries to the next
     scanline. This is what fixes the `PF2=$00` clear.
**Result:** Breakout screen-vs-xitari diff dropped **~8000 → 16 px/frame**
(the only residual is a 1 px paddle-X offset, 7 rows). Lower screen black,
no flicker. TIA/playfield/p3i/p3l unit tests green; jutari byte-identical to
jaxtari. The paddle X also tightened from 13 px off → 1 px off.
**Test gap closed (user's idea):** added `jaxtari/tests/test_screen_conformance.py`
(PXC-S) — diffs the *rendered framebuffer* xitari↔jaxtari and xitari↔jutari
per frame, with per-ROM `max_screen_diff` pins. This would have caught the
red columns immediately (RAM tests never could). Screen fixtures live in
`tools/fixtures/screens/*.screen.gz` (xitari + jutari, gzip — they compress to
<7 KB). Generator: `tools/jutari_screen_dump.jl`. **Finding it surfaced:**
most ROMs have large screen-vs-xitari divergence (pong ~4760, seaquest ~3946,
…) despite bit-exact RAM — pre-existing rendering-accuracy gaps now visible
and pinned.

### P3i-g — mid-instruction TIA-write cycle threading (2026-05-29)
**Commit:** `2e44bab` (code) + follow-up (PXC pins + jutari fixtures).
**Symptom (user report):** Breakout side wall on the right was at the wrong
position (pulled inward to x≈140 with a grey wall segment embedded in the
brick rows), a center seam through the bricks, and the paddle offset.
**Root cause:** the TIA was advanced once per CPU instruction in
`_tia_post_step`, so a TIA register *write* issued mid-instruction recorded
the beam at the **instruction-START** color clock — off by the cycles
already consumed (0..6 CPU cycles = 0..18 color clocks). Breakout draws its
walls + bricks by writing PF0/PF1/PF2 *mid-scanline* (racing the beam), so
every such write landed ~12 px too early. Verified against xitari's own
`UV_TIA_POKES` debug env var (set it when running `tools/trace_dump` to get
exact `xpos`/`delay`/`activation` per poke): on a brick scanline xitari
writes PF at xpos 66/111/132/153; jaxtari recorded 54/99/120/141 (−12 each).
**Fix:**
- `Bus` gains `pending_tia_cycles` (every peek/poke = one 6502 cycle) +
  `tia_advanced_this_instruction`. A TIA-region **write** flushes
  `tia_advance(tia, pending)` BEFORE the poke, so PF*/RESP*/HMOVE/COLU* land
  at the precise sub-instruction color clock — matching xitari's
  `M6502High::poke` (incrementCycles-before-access) → `TIA::poke` →
  `updateFrame(cycles*3)`. `_tia_post_step` drains the remainder.
- Indexed zero-page resolvers (`zp,X`/`zp,Y`) count their **cycle-3 dummy
  read** via `Bus.pending_tick` so `STA zp,X` to a PF/COLU register flushes 4
  cycles not 3 (closes the last 3 px of the wall: 149→152). A cycle-only
  tick is observably equivalent to the real dummy read because its bus value
  is always overwritten by the instruction's final access — and it avoids
  routing low-zero-page operands through the TIA collision/INPT catch-up path
  (which is ruinously slow in the Python renderer).
- jutari mirrors all of the above on its mutable `BusState`; jutari's
  `tia_poke!` `beam_cc`/`beam_sc` params (a parallel attempt at the same fix)
  default to the post-flush `color_clock`, so the two mechanisms compose.
**Result:** walls now flush at cols 0-7 / 152-159 in both ports (exact match
to xitari); brick rows continuous. **Bonus:** the accurate write timing also
closed the data-path gap — **pong 6→0, breakout 2→0 (BIT-EXACT)**, seaquest
6→4. **Cost:** enduro +3 (see "stale pin" note). PXC2 `jaxtari ≡ jutari`
preserved (ports byte-identical). jaxtari CPU/bus/TIA/P3 suites green.

### jutari SWCHB test fix (2026-05-29)
**Commit:** `065171f`. Task #64 changed the SWCHB default 0xFF→0x3F but only
updated the jaxtari test; the jutari "SELECT + RESET press" test still
asserted `0xFF & ~0x03`. Corrected to `0x3F & ~0x03` (= 0x3C). Pre-existing,
unrelated to P3i-g.

### jutari SOFT-PFP Zygote test (2026-05-29)
**Commit:** `efda8a3` (spawned task). Pre-existing SOFT-mode gradient test at
`jutari/test/runtests.jl:4911` that the SWCHB abort had been masking; the
COLUP0 assert now uses `atol` for denormal AD noise.

## Dead ends & gotchas (so we don't repeat them)

- **DO NOT name a throwaway script `bisect.py`** (or any stdlib module name)
  and run it from its own directory. Python puts the script dir on
  `sys.path[0]`, so stdlib `random.py`'s `import bisect` picks up *your*
  file. If your file imports jax, you get a baffling
  `ImportError: cannot import name 'typeof' from partially initialized
  module 'jax._src.core' (circular import)`. Cost us ~an hour chasing a
  phantom "broken jax env". Name scratch scripts uniquely.
- **jax 0.10.1 import-order fragility:** importing `jax.numpy`/`jax.lax`
  before a full `import jax` can trigger the same `typeof` circular import on
  a cold bytecode cache. jaxtari's normal entry points are fine; ad-hoc
  scripts should `import jax` first.
- **Frame-alignment off-by-one:** when hand-checking a port against xitari,
  make sure you compare the *same* frame index. An ad-hoc check comparing
  jaxtari frame 12 to a `trace_dump --max-frames 13 | tail -1` (= frame 13)
  produced a phantom "5-byte divergence" on breakout that does not exist
  (breakout is bit-exact). Use the canonical `*_noop_10.jsonl` fixtures.
- **Stale PXC pins:** the enduro pin claimed 29, but the suite had been
  aborting at an unrelated SWCHB test (task #64 era) *before* reaching the
  divergence check, so the pin was never refreshed. Measured live, the
  pre-P3i-g parent (`6aa18b5`) enduro is actually **43**. Always re-measure
  the baseline before attributing a "regression" to your change.
- **Read-side TIA flushing is too slow in the Python renderer:** flushing the
  TIA before every INPT/collision *read* (the fully xitari-faithful model)
  forces a scanline re-render on each INPT poll — Breakout's paddle loop
  reads INPT0 dozens of times per frame → ~6× slowdown — and it did *not*
  move the paddle. So P3i-g threads **writes only**; reads stay on the
  per-instruction model (`_tia_catch_up_collisions` partial catch-up).
- **`total_cycles` decoupling was a no-op:** we hypothesised the inline
  write-flush perturbed the dump-pot cycle counter (`total_cycles`) and added
  a `count_total_cycles=False` decoupling; frame-12 RAM was byte-identical
  with and without it, and PXC pong/breakout passed either way, so it was
  reverted. The dump-pot is not on the write path.

---

## Open ideas / planned (not yet done)

- **Pong screen 920 → lower (one-row-late cross-scanline transitions).** After the pt4 COLU mask dropped pong from 29760 → 920, the residual concentrates at three "full row diff" rows (24, 34, 194 — each 160 px = 480 px) plus a 16-21-row score-digit band at cols 36-127. Diagnosis: shifting jaxtari's pong DOWN by 1 row reduces the diff to 580 (177/209 rows match the shifted version), so the strip boundaries (top playfield 24-33, bottom playfield 194+) and the score-area transitions all activate **one scanline later in jaxtari than in xitari**. Hypothesis: the cross-scanline PF/COLU writes in pong (e.g. the PF=$ff that enables the top playfield strip) have their `beam_cc + delay` activation crossing into the next scanline in jaxtari but not in xitari, because jaxtari's cumulative `pending_tia_cycles` is one cycle ahead of `mySystem->cycles()` at the write — the same per-cycle bus-accuracy class that bounds PXC1 (and that the `zp,X` dummy-tick fixed for one case in pt1). The fix is the broader per-cycle accuracy work tracked above (store-mode `abs,X`/`abs,Y`/`(zp),Y` dummies, etc.), which would also tighten enduro and the others. Not a clean small fix.
- **Enduro convergence (43 → lower).** Enduro's large base divergence (43/128)
  is pre-existing and unrelated to P3i-g; P3i-g additionally broke 5
  collision-timing-sensitive cells (`$36 $47 $67 $68 $76`) while fixing 2
  (`$2e $46`). Hypothesis: the write-threading shifts *collision-detection*
  timing — enduro repositions sprites (cars) per-scanline via RESP/HMOVE, and
  those writes are applied **immediately** (not deferred like PF*), so a
  mid-scanline RESP changes the sprite position for the *whole* scanline
  render rather than only after the write. Next step: instrument collision
  reads (`tools`-style monkeypatch of `tia_peek` for regs $00-$07) on enduro
  parent-vs-mine, find the first CXxx read whose value diverges, then trace
  which object overlap at which color clock. A draft logger lives in the
  session notes (`collog.py`). Likely fix: **defer RESP/HMOVE sprite-position
  changes** to their activation color clock the same way PF* writes are
  deferred (per-pixel sprite X), so collision detection sees the right
  position at the right beam position. Same class of problem that caused the
  *original* P3i-g part-2 revert (`ed1e498`).
- **Breakout center seam (4 px at x≈76-79 on brick rows).** Pure-rendering
  residual at the playfield half-boundary — does NOT affect RAM (breakout is
  bit-exact). Needs full per-cycle bus accuracy / sub-pixel PF activation.
- **Paddle random-run drift.** On the *random-action* Breakout run (ball
  launched), the game state still diverges from xitari by deep frames (≈200+)
  even though noop is bit-exact — the post-launch ball/paddle collision
  dynamics accumulate small timing differences. Tied to the same
  collision-timing accuracy as enduro.
- **P3i-d2 (read-side threading), task #3.** The faithful "flush TIA before
  every read" model — deferred for the performance reason above. Would need a
  cheaper renderer (JIT/vectorised per-scanline) to be viable.
- **P4c dump-pot timing model, task #4.** Formula is already faithful
  (`tia_peek` INPT0-3 matches xitari's `(1.6·r·0.01e-6)·1.19e6` threshold +
  the VBLANK-D7 `dump_disabled_cycle` capture). The residual paddle-game gap
  was the write-timing chain, now closed (pong/breakout bit-exact). Remaining
  read-path accuracy is the per-cycle bus work above.
- **P7f-dx, task #5.** Wire collision *reads* into the SOFT bus + migrate the
  remaining SOFT-mode collision tests. Independent of the HARD-path work here.
- **Per-cycle bus accuracy for store-mode `abs,X`/`abs,Y`/`(zp),Y`.** These
  always dummy-read on a store (5/6-cycle) even without a page cross; jaxtari
  currently only dummy-reads on a page cross. Adding the unconditional
  store-dummy (cycle count + data_bus_state) is the documented PXC1 "missing
  internal-cycle bus exposures" remainder.
